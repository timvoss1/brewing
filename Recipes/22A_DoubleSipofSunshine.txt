Sean Lawson, owner of Lawson’s Finest Liquids, a small-batch brewery based in Warren, Vermont, shared this recipe for their Double Sunshine IPA, which is packed with juicy tropical fruit flavors and bright herbal aromas thanks to the abundance of U.S. grown hops.

ALL-GRAIN

Batch size: 5 gallons (19 liters) 
OG: 1.074 
FG: 1.013 
IBUs: 100+ 
ABV: 8%

MALT/GRAIN BILL
8.5 lb (3.85 kg) 2-row pale ale malt 
12 oz (340 g) Carapilsen malt 
2.5 lb (1.1 kg) Vienna-style malt 
1 lb (454 g) flaked oats 
6 oz (170 g) Caramunich-type malt

HOPS & ADDITIONS SCHEDULE
0.75 oz (21 g) Columbus [14% AAU] at 60 minutes 
1 oz (28 g) Citra [12.5% AAU] at 20 minutes 
1 lb (454 g) corn sugar at 10 minutes 
3 oz (85 g) Citra [12.5% AAU] at 5 minutes 
3 oz (85 g) Citra [12.5% AAU] at knockout 
3 oz (85 g) Citra [12.5% AAU] at dry hop

YEAST
Fermentis Safale US-05, Lallemand BRY-097, Wyeast 1056 (American Ale), or White Labs WLP001 (California Ale)

DIRECTIONS
Single infusion mash: Achieve a target mash of 152°F (67°C). Hold for 45 minutes, then raise to mash-out temperature and begin lauter phase.

Collect enough wort to boil 6.5 gallons (24.6 liters) and boil for 60 minutes, following the hops and additions schedule. After the boil is complete, begin a whirlpool in the kettle and let the knockout hops rest in the hot wort for at least 30 minutes before chilling.

Chill the wort rapidly to 68°F (20°C). Ferment at 68°F (20°C) for one week. Cool to 55°F (13°C) to settle the yeast. Dump the yeast from the bottom of the fermentor or rack to a clean, sanitized vessel. Add the dry hops and let the beer sit for an additional four to seven days at 55–57°F (13°C).

EXTRACT VERSION
Replace the 2-row and Carapilsen malts with 6 pounds (2.7 kg) of light liquid malt extract. Mix the crushed Vienna-style malt, flaked oats, and Caramunich-type malt into 2 gallons (7.6 liters) of water to achieve a temperature of 152°F (67°C). Hold at this temperature for 45 minutes.

Rinse the grains with 2.5 quarts (2.6 liters) of hot water, add the liquid extract, and bring to boil. Top off the kettle to 6.5 gallons (24.6 liters). Boil for 60 minutes, following the hops schedule and adding 1.5 lb (680 g) of corn sugar with 10 minutes left in the boil. Continue as directed above.
